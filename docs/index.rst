Welcome to miney's documentation!
======================================

Miney provides an interface to minetest server over network and/or internet.

First goal is to have fun and to use minetest as a sandbox for python.

**Do whatever you like:**

* Play and fiddle around while learning python
* Visualize data in unusual ways
* Automate things with bots
* Connect minetest to external services like twitter, ebay or adult video hubs ;)

**For the best way to get everything running, take a look at the :doc:`quickstart` tutorial.**
