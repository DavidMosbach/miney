Welcome to the Miney documentation!
====================================

Miney provides an interface to minetest server over network and/or internet.

First goal is to have fun and to use minetest as a sandbox for python.

**Do whatever you like:**

* Play and fiddle around while learning python
* Visualize data in unusual ways
* Automate things with bots
* Connect minetest to external services like twitter, ebay or whatsoever
* Do whatever you want!

.. important::

   For the best way to get everything running, take a look at the :doc:`quickstart` page.

.. warning::

   Miney is currently in beta, so it's usable but the API may change at any point.
