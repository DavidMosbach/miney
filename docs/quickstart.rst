Quickstart
==========

Welcome in the block sandbox!

Blockgames like Minecraft or Minetest give you the ideal playground for creative playing and building just like a real sandbox.
But other than real sandboxes, you can work on very large worlds together with your friends over the internet.
And you can use (very simplified) physics, save the progress and many more.

But what about learning programming while expressing your creativity? Why not automate things? Or build even greater things?
